# Embedded Systems Project at Embrizon Technologies
Projects completed participating the Internship programming at Embrizon Technologies
### Project-1: Interfacing a 4-digit seven-segment display with an Arduino to count from 0000 to 9999, updating every second.
Successfully designed and implemented a system that interfaces a 4-digit seven-segment display with an Arduino microcontroller. The system counts from 0000 to 9999, updating the display every second, demonstrating effective use of timer functions and display multiplexing techniques.
### Project-2: Interfacing a switch and an LED with an Arduino, displaying the switch status on the Serial Monitor and controlling the LED via serial commands.
Developed an interactive project where a switch and an LED are interfaced with an Arduino. The system reads and displays the real-time status of the switch on the Serial Monitor and allows control of the LED through serial input commands, showcasing bidirectional serial communication and input/output handling.
